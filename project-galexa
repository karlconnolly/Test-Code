#Project Galexa is a voice activated online assistant to help with various tasks. It uses UCIC's Ubi AVS Kit to use Amazon's Alexa service and Google's Assistant service.

$ arecord test.wav #records your mic
$ aplay test.wav #plays back your most recent recording

$ aplay–l
$ arecord-l #if the above steps didn't work, find the card numbers for each device that you're using

$ echo 'pcm.!default {
  type asym
  playback.pcm "plughw:NUM_1" #change NUM_1 with the number of your speaker card
  capture.pcm "plughw:NUM_2" #change NUM_2 with the number of your microphone card number
}’>~/.asoundrc

$ curl https://bitbucket.org/ucic-1/avskit/raw/master/install.sh | sh #installs the program for the assistant service

#after installing the program your raspberrypi should start acting as a wifi hotspot.
#the hotspot should be called UCIC_2 and the password should be ubiquartus1

$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/interfaces #creates a new interfaces file

#once the file opens, type this in.

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplus wlan0
auto wlan0

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        wpa-ssid "YOUR_WIFI_NAME" #change YOUR_WIFI_NAME with the name of your ssid
        wpa-psk "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD" #change YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD with your router password
        
#save the file by using Ctrl + x

& sudo reboot #reboots the raspberry pi and it should connect to the internet

#go to https://new-ip-address:3000 and replace new-ip-address with your raspberry pi IP address.
#these are all the main steps to get the AVS kit to start working!
